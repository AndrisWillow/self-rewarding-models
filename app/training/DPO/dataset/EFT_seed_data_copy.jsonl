I'm not too interested in how the story ends, only the beginning. The story is about a man that discovered he has the power to change his size at will. The catch, he's in the middle of a zombie apocalypse and seemed to have missed the evacuation. Making him the sole, non-zombie character. What are things that he might start doing?\n<response>Since he was not able to receive news of a zombie apocalypse, we can assume that he lives alone, have no close social relationships and does activities that do not require much direct access to the outside world. We may infer that they're quite antisocial or introverted in this case, and would most likely experiment on his ability to change sizes in his own room for a couple of days. Because of this he will have very good control over his powers prior to him even coming out.\n\nAt some point, he'll be curious as to what the reaction of other people would be if they found out that someone can change sizes. However, upon realizing that there aren't any people anymore, and that he's he only non-zombie person left, he may use his power to kill zombies by dropping large objects on them. Because of his solitary nature, he might continue staying in the city he was originally in, only going outside in his gigantic form in order to resupply what he needs.\n\nUnder the assumption that humanity and its military has continued to thrive, the existence of a giant in his city may have spread around. It would be unknown to the higherups of the military whether he's a new form of zombie or just a regular, gigantic human. However, the man, in his giant form, will undoubtedly notice any scouts such as jeepneys or helicopters spying on him. If he refuses to engage, the military may mark him as docile. If seen intentionally killing zombies, then they may mark him as a potential ally.\n\nWhat he will do in response to the military isn't clear, as he can easily decline it without much recourse, as he'd be able to disappear in front of them by becoming tiny enough to escape, or big enough to instantly defeat the military.\n\nOther things he could may be to experiment on how his size changes his metabolism; whether staying small might mean he can conserve his resources more easily; whether parts of his body stays the same size when he cuts it off and changes size, etc.\n\nFor something more directly related to the fact that he's in a zombie apocalypse, he might experiment on understanding how Zombies react to threats based on size.<\/response>\nAfter examining the user\u2019s instruction and the response:\n- Briefly justify your total score, up to 100 words.\n- Conclude with the score using the format: \u201cScore: <total points>\u201d\nRemember to assess from the AI Assistant perspective, utilizing web search knowledge as\nnecessary.

This allows developers to install packages without affecting the system's Python installation, making it easier to manage and maintain various versions of Python on a single machine. On a Mac, you can use a virtual environment by performing the following steps:\n\n1. Install a Python virtual environment manager, such as virtualenv or venv.\n2. Create a new virtual environment in a directory of your choice.\n3. Activate the virtual environment.\n4. Install any packages you need.\n5. Use the virtual environment to run your Python scripts.\n6. Deactivate the virtual environment when done.\n\nThere are many tutorials available online that can provide more detailed instructions on how to use virtual environments on a Mac. A popular virtual environment manager is `virtualenv`, which can be installed using `pip`, the Python package manager. Here's an example of how to use `virtualenv` to create a virtual environment on a Mac:\n\n```bash\n# Install virtualenv using pip\npip install virtualenv\n\n# Create a new virtual environment in the current working directory\nvirtualenv my_environment\n\n# Activate the virtual environment\nsource my_environment\/bin\/activate\n\n# Install packages using pip\npip install <package1> <package2> ...\n\n# Run Python scripts with the new packages installed\npython my_script.py\n```\nIt's important to note that any packages you install within a virtual environment will only be available within that environment, and not in the system Python install. This is one of the main benefits of using a virtual environment, as it allows you to experiment with new packages without affecting the rest of the system.\n\nUsing a virtual environment can be a great way to manage your Python development on a Mac. If you're working on multiple projects or need to use different versions of Python, virtual environments can help make the process much easier and more organized.<\/response>\nAfter examining the user\u2019s instruction and the response:\n- Briefly justify your total score, up to 100 words.\n- Conclude with the score using the format: \u201cScore: <total points>\u201d\nRemember to assess from the AI Assistant perspective, utilizing web search knowledge as\nnecessary.

This has led to an explosion of creativity and innovation in the industry, with many memorable indie titles emerging as a result.\n\n**6. Live service games and updates:**\nModern games often receive constant updates post-launch, with developers adding new content, fixing bugs, or making balance adjustments based on player feedback. This agile development process has changed the way games are made, with developers now looking at their games as evolving services rather than static products.\n\n**7. Social and multiplayer experiences:**\nOnline gaming, community features, and social media integration have become an integral part of modern game design. Developers must consider how players will interact with each other, both in-game and outside of the game, when designing titles that aim to foster strong communities and encourage social connections.\n\n**8. Monetization and business models:**\nNew business models, such as free-to-play and microtransactions, have changed the way games are funded and monetized. Developers must now consider not just the initial sale of a game but also the ongoing revenue streams generated through in-game purchases and additional content.\n\nOverall, the advent of new technology and platforms has made game design and development more complex, but also more exciting, with countless new possibilities for creating engaging and innovative experiences for players.<\/response>\nAfter examining the user\u2019s instruction and the response:\n- Briefly justify your total score, up to 100 words.\n- Conclude with the score using the format: \u201cScore: <total points>\u201d\nRemember to assess from the AI Assistant perspective, utilizing web search knowledge as\nnecessary.

I want to group by column \u201cx\u201d and find the average occurrence of the value \u201ca\u201d in column \u201cy\u201d per group. Also only count the occurrences when the value in \u201cz\u201d is not \u201cb\u201d.\n<response>You can use the `groupby` method in Pandas to group by the \"x\" column and use the `mean` method to find the average of the \"y\" column per group. To only count the occurrences of \"a\" when the value in \"z\" is not \"b\", you can create a boolean mask to filter out the rows where \"z\" is \"b\", and then use the `sum` method to count the number of \"a\" values. Finally, divide the count by the size of each group to find the average occurrence. Here's an example:\n\n```\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\n    \"x\": [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3],\n    \"y\": [\"a\", \"b\", \"a\", \"a\", \"b\", \"a\"],\n    \"z\": [\"c\", \"d\", \"c\", \"e\", \"f\", \"g\"]\n})\n\nmask = (df[\"y\"] == \"a\") & (df[\"z\"] != \"b\")\ngrouped = df.groupby(\"x\")\nresult = (grouped[\"y\"][mask].sum() \/ grouped.size()).reset_index(name=\"mean_a_occurrence\")\n```\n\nThe resulting `result` dataframe will contain two columns: \"x\" and \"mean_a_occurrence\".
