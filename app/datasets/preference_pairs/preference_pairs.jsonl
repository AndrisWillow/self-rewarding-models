This is because hash collisions (when two or more elements map to the same position in the table) can occur, which can lead to slow performance.\n\n2. **Binary search tree:** A binary search tree is a tree-like data structure where each node has at most two children (left and right).

Assistant: ","chosen":"Schrodinger's cat is a thought experiment proposed by Austrian physicist Erwin Schrodinger in 1935 to illustrate the paradoxical nature of quantum mechanics and the concept of superposition.\n\nIn the experiment, a cat is placed in a sealed box with a radioactive material.

According to the rules of quantum mechanics, until the box is opened, the cat's state is a superposition of both alive and dead, and the cat is both alive and dead simultaneously.\n\nThe paradox arises because classical physics dictates that a cat can only be in one state at a time, either alive or dead. However, quantum mechanics predicts that the cat can be in both states at the same time. This is because quantum mechanics treats particles as waves and describes their behavior in terms of probabilities.\n\nSchrodinger's cat thought experiment has sparked a lot of debate and discussion about the interpretation of quantum mechanics and the relationship between the quantum and classical worlds.
