Distracted Driving: Distracted driving is a major cause of car accidents. Distracted driving occurs when a driver takes their eyes off the road, hands off the wheel, or mind off driving. Common distractions include using a cell phone, eating, drinking, adjusting the radio, or talking to passengers. To prevent distracted driving, put away all distractions before driving, such as your phone, food, and other items. Focus on the road and drive defensively.\n\n2. Speeding: Speeding is a major contributor to car accidents. Driving over the speed limit or too fast for road conditions increases the risk of a crash. To prevent speeding, follow the posted speed limits and adjust your speed based on road conditions, such as weather and traffic.\n\n3. Drunk Driving: Drunk driving is a serious problem that causes many car accidents. Alcohol impairs judgment, reaction time, and coordination, making it difficult to drive safely. To prevent drunk driving, never drive after drinking alcohol, even if you only had a small amount. If you're planning to drink, arrange for a designated driver or use public transportation.\n\n4.

A heavier paper will make the plane sink faster.\nFold the wings so that they are pointed slightly upwards. This will help the plane glide through the air more easily.\nMake sure the wings are symmetrical. If one wing is longer or shorter than the other, the plane will fly unevenly and may not fly as far.\nFold the nose of the plane so that it is pointed downwards. This will help the plane fly straight and not spin out of control.\nFold the tail so that it is slightly curved. This will help the plane stay stable in the air and prevent it from spinning out of control.\nFold the wings so that they are slightly curved. This will help the plane fly more smoothly through the air.\nMake sure the paper is folded evenly.
